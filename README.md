# Grocerhack
An grocery optimization tool for figuring out how to get your macros as cheap as possible.

## Current Support and Future Plan
The project is currently under development, with the first stage being building the scraper for the grocery store Loblaws.
The next stage is to build a linear programming model that can choose which foods to eat in order to meet the minimum required macros, for the cheapest possible price.
The final stage would be to extend the project and add mutliple grocery store inventories, sales, a notification system, etc.
